# MyIPFlag
Shows a flag in your toolbar of the country corresponding to your external IP address. Could be useful for users of proxies/VPNs etc.
Uses flag icons from www.icondrawer.com (free with attribution) and a geolocation API www.ipinfo.io (free up to 1000 uses per day).

To install into Firefox, download and open the .xpi file.
The IP/flag will load on Firefox startup, or click the toolbar icon to refresh again.
